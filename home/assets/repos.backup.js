A big issue I ran into during testing was that I would need links, or access tokens, that would have to be painfully typed in by hand on each device. Furthermore, some of the devices could not even sign into an email client due to some security settings previously applied. I decided to create pasteDump for iOS and Android which would allow for fast link sharing between devices on various platforms using either a simple authentication system or a more popular Facebook single sign-on system.
